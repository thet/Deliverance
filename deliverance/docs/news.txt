0.4.3
-----

 * Add deliv_full_headers query string for href attributes to pass all headers
   to the subrequest (thet)

 * Add deliv_force_external query string for href attributes to force fetching
   resources as external requests. This allows to use a theme already themed by
   Deliverance (thet)

0.4.0
-----


 * Added a response-status matcher, for matching against the status code of the response.
   Use like <match response-status="404" class="notfounds" /> (esanchez) (#39)

 * Added a ReverseMatcher, which allows you to prefix a match statement with not: to reverse
   the result.  Use like <match path="not:/bad-path" /> (esanchez) (#39)

 * Added a boolean collapse-sources attribute on TransformActions
   (append, prepend, replace) which can signal that elements moved
   from the content to the theme should be "fully collapsed" into the
   theme immediately, allowing subsequent actions to act on those
   elements within the theme. 

 * Added support for mounting WSGI applications directly in the proxy,
   as an alternative to HTTP proxy endpoints. (#48)

 * Fixed error when trying to move or copy HTML comment nodes (#69)

 * Fixed error in deliverance-proxy when proxying HEAD requests (#66)

 * Factored out method ``DeliveranceMiddleware.default_theme(self, environ)``
   so that subclasses can implement custom logic for calculating the global
   default theme per request based on the WSGI environment and the value of
   ``self._default_theme`` which is set by the ``theme_uri`` parameter in
   the paste.deploy configuration.

   The default implementation returns the raw string ``self._default_theme``
   directly.

 * Factored out method ``DeliveranceMiddleware.build_external_subrequest``
   which is called when Deliverance is getting a resource via an external
   subrequest (as opposed to a file:// URL or an internal subrequest to the
   application being wrapped by Deliverance)

   The method returns a webob.Request object; the default implementation
   returns a blank Request with only the header
   ``x-deliverance-theme-subrequest`` set.  Subclasses can override
   this behavior, e.g. to preserve certain headers from the original
   request into subrequests. 

 * Factored out method ``DeliveranceMiddleware.notheme_request(self, request)``
   so that subclasses can customize the logic to determine which requests
   should never be themed by Deliverance.  

   The default implementation checks for "deliv_notheme" in the querystring.

 * Moved tests from test_middleware.txt to test_middleware.py, and converted
   to WebTest, to improve clarity of tests and ease of adding new tests.


0.3.1
-----

 * Compatible with WebOb 1.0 (or 0.9.8)

 * Remove dependency_link for unpinned trunk of DevAuth

0.3.0
-----

 * Pass open file objects to lxml instead of filenames. Apparently 
   lxml can segfault in some circumstances if you pass a filename 
   for it to open multiple times. (kiorky)

 * Reorganized pyref documentation into a single document for easier
   reference.

 * Added a document on configuring Deliverance with Paste Deploy.

0.3c4
-----

 * Characters <, >, and & are no longer escaped when they appear
   within a CDATA section in XHTML output mode.

 * The theme's doctype is now given priority over the content
   doctype, to give users more control over the output format.

0.3c3
-----

 * The paste.deploy configuration and middleware factory now accept a `theme_uri`
   parameter.

   If used, this will be the global default theme uri.  It will be used if no
   theme is defined within the ruleset.

 * Internal subrequests that return non-200 response codes are now retried as external
   HTTP requests. (#16)

 * Request/response matching in <rule> elements now work. (#6)

 * <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"> tags are no longer stripped from documents.
   Instead, they are always included in the output of Deliverance, with a default
   charset of ASCII. (#34)

 * CDATA sections in XHTML documents are left as-is instead of being incorrectly
   escaped. (#36)

 * Before applying the rules, Deliverance now moves the <meta> tag with a charset
   declaration to be the first child of the <head> element, if both are present.
   This ensures that non-ASCII characters in the <head> are converted to the correct
   HTML sequences. (#12)

 * There is now a garbage-collecting WSGI middleware `deliverance.garbagecollect`,
   disabled by default, which calls `gc.collect()` after every request. This was
   added after a report (unconfirmed) of potential memory leaks when using some
   versions of lxml. (#22)

   You can use it with `deliverance-proxy --garbage-collect` or, in paste.deploy
   configurations, filter your app with `use = egg:Deliverance#garbagecollect`.

0.3c2
-----

* FileRuleGetter now reloads the rules file on every request if Deliverance is initialized
  with debug=true.

* If the content document declares an XHTML doctype, then the output will be valid XML. (#28)

* If the content document declares any doctype, that doctype will be preserved in the output.
  Otherwise, the theme's doctype will be used if present. If neither document has a doctype,
  the default is HTML 4.0 Transitional. (#28)

* rule_uri can now be a file:// URI

* You can now set execute_pyref=true in Paste Deploy .ini file to allow pyrefs in the rules when
  using the Deliverance middleware directly. 

* Fixed "join_attributes tries to join on list and set which is not valid" (#18)

* Fixed util.filetourl breakage on Windows. (#13)

* Added XInclude support in rules file.

* Empty links in the theme like <a href=""> both work now; in the last release Deliverance would
  throw an error when trying to parse these. (#31)

* When fetching the content document, responses with Content-Length:0 will be passed through to
  the client. Previously these would cause an error. (#25)

0.3 prerelease
--------------

* Add a monkeypatch for Paste to work around a long unsolved robustness bug.

* Correctly handle in-document links in the theme. Patch from Michael Dunstan.
  This fixes #19 and #31.

* Added :class:`deliverance.middleware:FileRuleGetter`

* Added `Paste Deploy <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/>`_ entry point
  (``egg:Deliverance``).

* Plenty more
